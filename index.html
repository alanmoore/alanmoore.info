    <h1 class="am-main__header">Hello, I'm Alan. </h1>
    <p>I bridge the gap between UX and development. I have 25 years experience in creating, launching and maintaining
      web applications and websites. </p>
      <p>I am particularly interested in information architecture (IA) and the functional user experience (UX) design
    of complex workflows in long-life applications. </p>
    <p>Currently, I spend my time leading the user experience of web and mobile applications at fintech startup
      <a href="#">Tongo Financial</a>. </p>
      <p>You can read about my full work experience in  <a href="#">my resume</a>, available as a PDF. It tells
        you all about my previous lives. </p>
      <p>Since 2014, I have specialised in User Experience and Interaction Design. I have worked on several
      enterprise-sized web applications: </p>

        <p>At <a href="#">Tongo</a>, I was part of the team that designed and built the initial versions of the
          applications that the business runs on: a Dashboard through which customers sign up and manage their accounts;
          a back-of-office admin system used by admins, underwriters and customer support agents to support the business;
          and most recently I have produced designs for the iOS and Android apps. </p>

          Webware with a 100% custom software stack. Mostly made up of tabular data and form input screens, we
          customised a Bootstrap template I gave it more muted colors with a very consistent look and feel. This was

            action. It had a very long gestation period that produced the wireframe at top left and many rejected
            designs like the one shown at bottom left. These were enough to decide to build the product. <br />
          The Senior Director of Engineering and I built and launched the Portal in under two months with limited
          requirements, applying best practices in lieu of any design or detailed workflows. The two screens on the
            right show the Order Listing and Order Details screens. As it contained everything we needed to build a
            rich site, I selected Kendo UI, then learned it and implemented it in HTML and CSS. </span>

        system, and introduce a new Material Design design language. We expanded the New Event screen to a full Wizard
