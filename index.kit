        I bridge the gap between UX and development. I have 25 years experience in creating, launching and maintaining
        web applications and websites.
      </p>
        <p>I am particularly interested in information architecture (IA) and the functional user experience (UX) design
      of complex workflows in long-life applications. </p>
      <p>Currently, I spend my time leading the user experience of web and mobile applications at fintech startup
        <a href="https://gettongo.com">Tongo Financial</a>. </p>

          you all about my previous lives. </p>
        <p>Since 2014, I have specialised in User Experience and Interaction Design. In that time,  have worked on several
        enterprise-sized web applications, and at one startup. </p>

        <h2 class="am-main__header">Tongo Financial</h2>
        <p>At <a href="https://gettongo.com">Tongo</a>, we created a new range of products to aid the self-employed manage the gaps between
          their commissions. I was part of the team that designed and built the initial versions of the applications that
          the business runs on.</p>
        <p>First, we built a Dashboard and self-service web app, through which customers sign up and manage their
          accounts. </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Tongo%20Dashboard@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote"><strong>Three views of the Tongo web app Dashboard</strong>, showing  mobile,
            tablet and desktop breakpoints.</span>
        </figure>
        <p>Next, a back-of-office admin system used by our staff, such as underwriters and customer support agents to
          run the business. This is not shown, due to containing proprieatry information. I worked with an external
          graphic designer to polish this interface. </p>
        <p>Most recently I have produced designs for the iOS and Android apps, as we identified native functionality
          which could not betaken advantage of via browser. </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Tongo%20iOS%20Sign%20Up@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote">
            <strong>Tongo iOS app</strong><br />
            <em>Top row:</em> The Tongo iOS app signup flow, with the first login view of the dashboard to
            the right. <br />
            <em>Bottom:</em> Log in flow, showing password, Touch ID and Face ID flows, plus a view of the dashboard
            once the app is being used. </span>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Tongo%20iOS%20Other%20Screens@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote"><strong>Various screens from the Tongo iOS app.</strong> <br />
            <em>Top row, from left to right:</em> Dashboard, Manage Cards, and the Schedule Payment flow. <br />
            <em>Bottom row:</em> Transfer Money flow, Deal details view, with Change Closing Date flow. </span>
        </figure>
        <p>We identified that over 80% of our users were visiting on a mobile device. With this in mind, many screens
        in the web app were designed for mobile,. and the decision was made not to pad them with extraneous visual
        affectations when viewed on a large screen.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Tongo%20Signup@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote">The Tongo signup flow in the web app. Three screens from the flow are presented at
            mobile size, and to the right is one of those screens as presented on a desktop. </span>
        </figure>
        <p>As a startup spinning up a completely new product and the technology to support it, we iterated often.
          We also went through a rebranding, and several different potential company names and Corporate IDs were
          provided by our marketing firm. This is a selection of supporting materials from the 2 years spent building
          and launching Tongo.</p>

            the home page, a dashboard based on a rejected design, and part of the sign up flow using an early version

        <h2 class="am-main__header">Studio Designer</h2>
        <p>Most of my time at Studio Designer was spent on Studio Core, the accounting and project management software.
          Embedded in a fully-remote, high performance development team, we launched version 2.0 of the product,
          replacing the Salesforce-based Studio Webware with a 100% custom software stack.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Studio%20Designer@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote">Various screens from Studio Core. This was  Mostly made up of tabular data and form
            input screens. We customised a Bootstrap template I gave it more muted colors with a very consistent look
            and feel. This was living software used live by thousands of people at once to run their businesses. </span>
        </figure>
        <p>Most of my output was in the form of wireframes, user flows, and interactive prototypes. </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Studio%20Designer%20Background%20Materials@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote">Background materials from development of Studio Core. Here are three user flows,
            two simple, one complex, and a wireframe design for an Accounting dashboard. </span>
        </figure>
        <p>Alongside Core, I worked on sister products like Client Portal, aclient self-service application.  </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Studio%20Designer%20Client%20Portal@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote">Two designs showing the redesigned, more consistent look of proposals and invoices
          presented by designers to their clients using the Client Portal. The document part of the screen is designed
            to resemble a paper document, but also scale with the browser viewport. </span>
        </figure>
        <p>The Vendor Portal was a doomed enterprise that required some quick thinking and
          action. It had a very long gestation period that produced the wireframe at top left and many rejected
          designs. These were enough to decide to build the product. </p>
        <p>The Senior Director of Engineering and I built and launched the Portal in under two months with limited
          requirements, applying best practices in lieu of any design or detailed workflows. As it contained everything we
          needed to build a
          rich site, I selected Kendo UI, then learned it and implemented it in HTML and CSS.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/img/Studio%20Designer%20Vendor%20Portal@1x.png">
          <span class="marginnote">This figure shows two rejected dashboard designs from the inital gestation period
            on the left. The two screens on the right show the Order Listing and Order Details screens. </span>

        <h2 class="am-main__header">ACGI Software</h2>
        <p>ACGI provided Association Management (AMS) and Certification to clubs and associations, from five member group
          medical professionals to the PGA. I was embedded in their development team, working on the base version of
        Association Anywhere, from which all custom installations were derived. </p>

        <span class="marginnote">A design for a dashboard in Association Anywhere. Shown at two screen sizes: mobile,

          all 10 primary modules in the software suite. </span>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="/img/ACGI%20Event%20Wizard@1x.png">
        <span class="marginnote">As a sprawling suite of software in active development for 16 years, some screens were
        incredibly old and outdated. The Event Creation screen in the Meetings module was a screen built using late
        90's technology. We used this as an opportunity to update the technology to the newer Oracle Apex templating
        system, and introduce a new Material Design design language. We expanded the New Event screen to a full Wizard
          that walked the user through the process in a more understandable manner. </span>
      </figure>
    <p>One project with a huge amount of reach was the complete redesign of the Association Anywhere navigation.
      A complex information architecture for over 1,400 pages.</p>

    <p>Other, less glamorous projects included an initiative to integrate Social Media logins with the self-

        <p>Regent's main product was Regent Enterprise Management, a SaaS suite for managing and dispersing financial
          aid to students. </p>
        <p>The Student Financial Calculator would
          accurately predict the cost of attending college for a student, and show any available grants or loans,
          providing a final, out-of-pocket price for attending school.</p>

            using Regent Enterprrise Management. </span>

          <span class="marginnote">For this screen I interviewed users, producing the workflows presented top left. Next, I created a

          build from. The screenshots in the pages displayed are taken from the Axure protoype. The pages shown here
          were made available in the company documentation intranet, and then added to by a Business Analyst for back-end
            and database requirements. </span>
        </figure>
        <p>This was a beast of a project: to provide a heuristic review of the entire Regent
          Enterprise Management software suite. It turns out that groups of developers doing their very best with no UX guidance for over a decade
